##0X0B. C- DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION USING malloc AND free
In this project, I used the C library functions for dynamic memory allocation-
 'malloc' and 'free', to allocate memoryies for data types and variables in C.

The C files in this repository and their uses are as follows:

1. 0-create_array.c - Creates an array of characters and initializes it with
	a specific character.

2. 1-strdup.c - Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which
	contains a copy of the string given as parameter.

3. 2-str_concat.c - Concatenates two strings.

4. 3-alloc_grid.c - Returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers.

5. 4-free_grid.c - Frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by the
	alloc_grid function above.
