###OBJECT-LIKE MACROS

In this project, I worked with macros in C to perform simple tasks.

The files in this project and their respective functions are as follows:

1. 0-object_like_macro.h - Defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for
	the token 1024.
2. 1-pi.h - Defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token
	3.14159265359.
3. 2-main.c - Prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a
	new line.
4. 3-function_like_macro.h - Computes the absolute value of a number x.

5. 4-sum.h - Computes the sum of the numbers  x and y.
