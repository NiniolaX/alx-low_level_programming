##C COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

In this project, I wrote some simple programss that demonstrate the use of
command line arguments.

1. 0-whatsmyname.c - Prints its(the program) name.
2. 1-args.c - Prints the number of arguments passed to it.
3. 2-args.c - Prints all arguments it receives.
4. 3-mul.c - Multiplies two numbers passed to it from the CL.
5. 4-add.c - Adds positive numbers in the arguments passed to it from CL.
6. 100-change.c - Prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount
	of money passed to it from the CL.
