##0x10 C - Variadic Functions

In this project, I wrote a few variadic functions that perform simpe tasks.

The C files in this project and their respective functions are as follows:

1. 0-sum_them_all.c - Returns the sum of all its parameters
2. 1-print_numbers.c - Prints numbers
3. 2-print_strings.c - Prints strings
4. 3-print_all.c - Prints anything
