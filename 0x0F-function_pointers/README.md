##0x0F. C - FUNCTION POINTERS
In this project, I used pointers to functions to perform various operations
in programs.

Here is a desription of each file inthis repository:

1. 0-print_name.c - Prints a name.
2. 1-array_iterator.c - Executes a function given as parameter on each element
	of an array.
3. 2-int_index.c - Searches for an integer.
