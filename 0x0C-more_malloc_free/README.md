##0X0B. C- DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION USING malloc AND free

In this project, I used the C library functions malloc and free to dynamically
allocate memory in the following string manipulation functions.
The only other C standard library used are putchar and exit.

The C programs and their respective functions are as follows:

1. 0-malloc_checked.c - Allocates memory using malloc.

2. 1-string_nconcat.c - Concatenates two string.

3. 2-calloc.c - Allocates memory for an array using malloc.

4. 3-array_range.c - Creates an array of integers.
