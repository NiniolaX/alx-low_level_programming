##RECURSION IN C
In this project, I wrote simple C functions using recursion.
They are:
1. 0-puts_recursion.c - Prints a string followed by a new line
2. 1-print_rev_recursion.c - Prints a string in reverse.
3. 2-strlen_recursion.c - Returns the length of a string.
4. 3-factorial.c - Returns the factorial of a given number.
5. 4-pow_recursion.c - Returns the value of x raised to power y.
6. 5-sqrt_recursion.c - Returns the natural square root of a number.
7. 6-is_prime_number.c - Checks if an input integer is a prime number.
